# Blog_Site Backend

This is a backend for a blog web application built using **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **Spring Boot**, and **MongoDB**. This app allows users to register, create, and manage their own posts, as well as view posts created by others. The backend is powered by **Spring Boot** and **MongoDB**, and it integrates features such as authentication, CRUD operations, and image file handling.

## Key Features

- **User Account Creation**: Users can register and create their own accounts.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can add, update, delete, and view posts. Each post includes details like title, content, and an image, etc.
- **MVC Architecture**: The app follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture for better organization and maintainability.
- **MongoDB**: **MongoDB Atlas** is used as the backend database for storing user data and posts.
- **Lombok**: The project utilizes **Lombok** to minimize boilerplate code by generating getters, setters, and other utility methods.
- **Spring Security**: **Spring Security** is implemented to handle authentication, ensuring that only registered users can access and modify posts.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: The app uses role-based access control, allowing specific user roles to perform authorized actions.
- **Image Handling**: Users can upload images alongside their posts. The backend manages image storage and retrieval.
